1- What is Idempotency??

Idempotency is an important thing while building a fault-tolerant RESTful API.

No matter, how many times you call, the result is the same. This is the meaning of Idempotency.

For example, you had hit post request and it fails some how. We need to figure where exactly is the failure.
Is it at sending request or at updating db.

But, for put request, you can hit multiple times without worrying about , if it actually failed or not.

Options, get, head , delete and put are Idempotent
Post and patch are not Idempotent.
